# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis
Customer Experience (CX) Analytics: Inbound Call Analysis Project

In this project, you will analyze the inbound calling performance of a company's Customer Experience (CX) team using a dataset covering 23 days of call data. This dataset includes key metrics such as agent names and IDs, queue times, call times, call durations, and call statuses (answered, abandoned, or transferred). The goal is to derive valuable insights from this data to improve call handling efficiency and customer satisfaction. By understanding the patterns and performance metrics, the project aims to optimize the inbound call process.

Business Understanding  
Customer experience teams play a critical role in managing and improving customer interactions. Effective advertising strategies are essential to connect businesses with their target audience. For the CX team, handling incoming calls is a key part of customer support. Analyzing call volume trends helps identify how to improve customer service, reduce abandonment rates, and ensure a smooth call process for customers.

Tasks and Approach Using MS Excel  
1. Average Call Duration by Time Bucket:  
   Use Excel functions like `AVERAGEIF` to calculate the average call duration for each time bucket.

2. Call Volume per Time Bucket:  
   Create a Pivot Table to group the data by time buckets and call statuses, then use Excel charts (e.g., bar or line charts) to visualize the call volume.

3. Minimum Agents to Reduce Abandon Rate:  
   Calculate the abandon rate by dividing the number of abandoned calls by total calls. Use Excel's `IF` function to model scenarios where the abandon rate is reduced to 10% and determine the minimum agent count required.

4. Manpower Planning:  
   Develop a manpower plan using formulas to distribute agents based on call volume and abandon rates, ensuring that no time bucket exceeds a 10% abandon rate.

By leveraging Excel's analysis and visualization tools, you will generate data-driven insights to optimize agent allocation, reduce wait times, and improve the overall customer experience.
